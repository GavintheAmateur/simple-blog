            </div>
            <pre class="article-body">
                I am nature’s greatest miracle. 
    
    Since the beginning of time never has there been another with my mind, my heart, 
    my eyes, my ears, my hands, my hair, my mouth. None that came before, none that 
    live today, and none that come tomorrow can walk and talk and move and think 
    exactly like me. All men are my brothers yet I am different from each. I am a unique 
    creature. 
    
    I am nature’s greatest miracle. 
    
    Although I am of the animal kingdom, animal rewards alone will not satisfy me. 
    Within me burns a flame, which has been passed from generations uncounted, and its 
    heat is a constant irritation to my spirit to become better than I am, and I will. I will 
    fan this flame of dissatisfaction and proclaim my uniqueness to the world. 
    
    None can duplicate my brush strokes, none can duplicate my chisel marks, none can 
    duplicate my handwriting, none can produce my child, and, in truth, none has the 
    ability to sell exactly as I. Henceforth, I will capitalize on this difference for it is an 
    asset to be promoted to the fullest. 
    
    I am nature’s greatest miracle. 

    <img src="/img/4.jpg">
    
    Vain attempts to imitate others no longer will I make. Instead I will place my 
    uniqueness on display in the market place. I will proclaim it, yea, I will sell it. I will 
    begin now to accent my differences; hide my similarities. So too will I apply this 
    principle to the goods I sell. Salesman and goods, different from all others, and proud 
    of the differences. 
    
    I am a unique creature of nature. 
    
    I am rare, and there is value in all rarity; therefore, I am valuable. I am the end 
    product of thousands of years of evolution; therefore, I am better equipped in both 
    mind and body than all the emperors and wise men who preceded me. But my skills, 
    my mind, my heart, and my body will stagnate, rot, and die lest I put them to good 
    use. I have unlimited potential. Only a small portion of my brain do I employ; only a 
    paltry amount of muscles do I flex. A hundredfold or more can I increase my 
    accomplishments of yesterday and this I will do, beginning today. 
    
    Nevermore will I be satisfied with yesterday’s accomplishments nor will I indulge, 
    anymore, in self-praise for deeds which in reality are too small to even acknowledge. 
    I can accomplish far more than I have, and I will, for why should the miracle which 
    produced me end with my birth? Why can I not extend that miracle to my deeds of 
    today? 
    
    I am nature’s greatest miracle. 
    
    I am not on this earth by chance. I am here for a purpose and that purpose is to grow 
    into a mountain, not to shrink to a grain of sand. Henceforth will I apply all my 
    efforts to become the highest mountain of all and I will strain my potential until it 
    cries for mercy. 
    
    I will increase my knowledge of mankind, myself, and the goods I sell, thus my sales 
    will multiply. I will practice, and improve, and polish the words I utter to sell my 
    goods, for this is the formulation on which I will build my career and never will I 
    forget that many have attained great wealth and success with only one sales talk, 
    delivered with excellence. Also will I seek constantly to improve my manners and 
    graces, for they are the sugar to which all are attracted. 
    
    I am nature’s greatest miracle. 
    
    I will concentrate my energy on the challenge of the moment and my actions will 
    help me forget all else. The problems of my home will be left in my home. I will 
    think naught of my family when I am in the market place for this will cloud my 
    thoughts. So too will the problems of the market place be left in the market place and 
    I will think naught of my profession when I am in my home for this will dampen my 
    love. 
    
    There is no room in the market place for my family, nor is there room in my home 
    for the market. Each I will divorce from the other and thus will I remain wedded to 
    both. Separate must they remain or my career will die. This is the paradox of the 
    ages. 
    
    
    
    I am nature’s greatest miracle. 
    
    
    
    
    I have been given eyes to see and a mind to think and now I know a great secret of 
    life for I perceive, at last, that all my problems, discouragements, and heartaches are, 
    in truth, great opportunities in disguise. I will no longer be fooled by the garments 
    they wear for mine eyes are open. I will look beyond the cloth and I will not be 
    deceived. 
    
    I am nature’s greatest miracle. 
    
    No beast, no plant, no wind, no rain, no rock, no lake had the same beginning as I, 
    for I was conceived in love and brought forth with a purpose. In the past I have not 
    considered this fact but it will henceforth shape and guide my life. 
    
    I am nature’s greatest miracle. 
    
    And nature knows not defeat. Eventually, she emerges victorious and so will I, and 
    with each victory the next struggle becomes less difficult. 
    
    I will win, and I will become a great salesman, for I am unique. 
    
    I am nature’s greatest miracle.
