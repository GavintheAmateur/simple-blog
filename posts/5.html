                I will live this day as if it is my last. 
    
                And what shall I do with this last precious day, which remains I my keeping? First, I 
                will seal up its container of life so that not one drop spills itself upon the sand. I will 
                waste not a moment mourning yesterday’s misfortunes, yesterday’s defeats, 
                yesterday’s aches of the heart, for why should I throw good after bad? 
                
                Can sand flow upward in the hourglass? Will the sun rise where it sets and set where 
                it rises? Can I relive the errors of yesterday and right them? Can I call back 
                yesterday’s wounds and make them whole? Can I become younger than yesterday? 
                Can I take back the evil that was spoken, the blows that were struck, the pain that 
                was caused? No. Yesterday is buried forever and I will think of it no more. 
                
                I will live this day as if it is my last. 
                
                And what then shall I do? Forgetting yesterday neither will I think of tomorrow. Why 
                should I throw now after maybe? Can tomorrow’s sand flow through the glass before 
                today’s? Will the sun rise twice this morning? Can I perform tomorrow’s deeds while 
                standing in today’s path? Can I place tomorrow’s gold in today’s purse? Can 
                tomorrow’s child be born today? Can tomorrow’s death cast its shadow backward 
                and darken today’s joy? Should I concern myself over events, which I may never 
                witness? Should I torment myself with problems that may never come to pass? No! 
                Tomorrow lies buried with yesterday, and I will think of it no more. 
                
                I will live this day as if it is my last. 
                
                This day is all I have and these hours are now my eternity. I greet this sunrise with 
                cries of joy as a prisoner who is reprieved from death. I lift mine arms with thanks 
                for this priceless gift of a new day. So too, I will beat upon my heart with gratitude as 
                I consider all who greeted yesterday’s sunrise who are no longer with the living 
                today. I am indeed a fortunate man and today’s hours are but a bonus, undeserved. 
                Why have I been allowed to live this extra day when others, far better than I have 
                departed? Is it that they have accomplished their purpose while mine is yet to be achieved? 
                Is this another opportunity for me to become the man I know I can be? Is 
                there a purpose in nature? Is this my day to excel? 
                
                I will live this day as if it is my last.

                </figure>
                I have but one life and life is naught but a measurement of time. When I waste one I 
                destroy the other. If I waste today I destroy the last page of my life. Therefore, each 
                hour of this day will I cherish for it can never return. It cannot be banked today to be 
                withdrawn on the morrow, for who can trap the wind? Each minute of this day will I 
                grasp with both hands and fondle with love for its value is beyond price. What dying 
                man can purchase another breath though he willingly give all his gold? What price 
                dare I place on the hours ahead? I will make them priceless! 
                
                I will live this day as if it my last. 
                
                I will avoid with fury the killers of time. Procrastination I will destroy with action; 
                doubt I will bury under faith; fear I will dismember with confidence. Where there are 
                idle mouths I will listen not; where there are idle hands I will linger not; where there 
                are idle bodies I will visit not. Henceforth I know that to court idleness is to steal 
                food, clothing, and warmth from those I love. I am not a thief. I am a man of love 
                and today is my last chance to prove my love and my greatness. 
                
                I will live this day as if it is my last. 
                
                The duties of today I shall fulfill today. Today I shall fondle my children while they 
                are young; tomorrow they will be gone, and so will I. Today I shall embrace my 
                woman with sweet kisses; tomorrow she will be gone, and so will I. Today I shall lift 
                up a friend in need; tomorrow he will no longer cry for help, nor will I hear his cries. 
                Today I shall give myself in sacrifice and work; tomorrow I will have nothing to 
                give, and there will be none to receive. 
                
                I will live this day as if it is my last. 
                
                And if it is my last, it will be my greatest monument. This day I will make the best 
                day of my life. This day I will drink every minute to its full. I will savor its taste and 
                give thanks. I will maketh every hour count and each minute. I will trade only for 
                something of value. I will labor harder than ever before and push my muscles until 
                they cry for relief, and then I will continue. I will make more calls than ever before. I 
                will sell more goods than ever before. I will earn more gold than ever before. Each 
                
                
                
                
                minute of today will be more fruitful than hours of yesterday. My last must be my 
                best. 
                
                I will live this day as if it is my last. And if it is not, I shall fall to my knees and give 
                thanks.
