                    <p>        Today I begin a new life. 

                        Today I shed my old skin, which hath, too long, suffered the bruises of failure andthe wounds of mediocrity. 
                        
                        Today I am born anew and my birthplace is a vineyard where there is fruit for all.      
                        
                        Today I will pluck grapes of wisdom from the tallest and fullest vines in thevineyard, for these were planted by the wisest of my profession who have comebefore me, generation upon generation. 
                        
                        Today I will savor the taste of grapes from these vines and verily I will swallow theseed of success buried in each and new life will sprout within me. 
                        
                        The career I have chosen is laden with opportunity yet it is fraught with heartbreakand despair and the bodies of those who have failed, were they piled one atopanother, would cast its shadow down upon all the pyramids of the earth.
