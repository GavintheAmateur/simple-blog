                    <p>Today I begin a new life. <br>

                        Today I shed my old skin, which hath, too long, suffered the bruises of failure andthe wounds of mediocrity.<br> 
                        
                        Today I am born anew and my birthplace is a vineyard where there is fruit for all...

                        For this is the greatest secret of success in all ventures. Muscle can split a shield and 
                        even destroy life but only the unseen power of love can open the hearts of men and 
                        until I master this art I will remain no more than a peddler in the market place...

                        In the Orient young bulls are tested for the fight arena in a certain manner. Each is 
                        brought to the ring and allowed to attack a picador who pricks them with a lance. The 
                        bravery of each bull is then rated with care according to the number of times he 
                        demonstrates his willingness to charge in spite of the sting of the blade. Henceforth 
                        will I recognize that each day I am tested by life in like manner. If I persist, if I 
                        continue to try, if I continue to charge forward, I will succeed.

                        Since the beginning of time never has there been another with my mind, my heart, 
                        my eyes, my ears, my hands, my hair, my mouth. None that came before, none that 
                        live today, and none that come tomorrow can walk and talk and move and think 
                        exactly like me. All men are my brothers yet I am different from each. I am a unique 
                        creature. 
                        
                        I am nature’s greatest miracle.

                        And what shall I do with this last precious day, which remains I my keeping? First, I 
                        will seal up its container of life so that not one drop spills itself upon the sand. I will

                        The tides advance; the tides recede. Winter goes and summer comes. Summer wanes 
                        and the cold increases. The sun rises; the sun sets. The moon is full; the moon is 
                        black. The birds arrive; the birds depart. Flowers bloom; flowers fade. Seeds are 
                        sown; harvests are reaped. All nature is a circle of moods and I am a part of nature 
                        and so, like the tides, my moods will rise; my moods will fall. 
                        
                        Today I will be master of my emotions.
