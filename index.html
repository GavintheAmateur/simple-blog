                <p>Today I begin a new life. <br>

                    Today I shed my old skin, which hath, too long, suffered the bruises of failure andthe wounds of
                    mediocrity.<br>

                    Today I am born anew and my birthplace is a vineyard where there is fruit for all...

                    For this is the greatest secret of success in all ventures. Muscle can split a shield and
                    even destroy life but only the unseen power of love can open the hearts of men and
                    until I master this art I will remain no more than a peddler in the market place...

                <p>I will persist until I succeed.

                    In the Orient young bulls are tested for the fight arena in a certain manner. Each is
                    brought to the ring and allowed to attack a picador who pricks them with a lance. The
                    bravery of each bull is then rated with care according to the number of times he
                    demonstrates his willingness to charge in spite of the sting of the blade. Henceforth
                    will I recognize that each day I am tested by life in like manner. If I persist, if I
                    continue to try, if I continue to charge forward, I will succeed.

                <p>I am nature’s greatest miracle.

                    Since the beginning of time never has there been another with my mind, my heart,
                    my eyes, my ears, my hands, my hair, my mouth. None that came before, none that
                    live today, and none that come tomorrow can walk and talk and move and think
                    exactly like me. All men are my brothers yet I am different from each. I am a unique
                    creature.

                    I am nature’s greatest miracle.

                    will seal up its container of life so that not one drop spills itself upon the sand. I will
                    waste not a moment mourning yesterday’s misfortunes, yesterday’s defeats,
                    yesterday’s aches of the heart, for why should I throw good after bad?

                    The tides advance; the tides recede. Winter goes and summer comes. Summer wanes
                    and the cold increases. The sun rises; the sun sets. The moon is full; the moon is
                    black. The birds arrive; the birds depart. Flowers bloom; flowers fade. Seeds are
                    sown; harvests are reaped. All nature is a circle of moods and I am a part of nature
                    and so, like the tides, my moods will rise; my moods will fall.

                    Today I will be master of my emotions.
